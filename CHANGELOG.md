# Changelog

## v1.1.20

Legacy cleanup and startup fallback fixes.

- Removed the old SwitchySharp/SwitchyOptions migration path so startup no
  longer attempts to import pre-SwitchyAgain localStorage config.
- Removed the background OmegaDebug entrypoint and issue-template flow, and
  renamed the MV3 compatibility preload to the runtime preload while keeping
  the required MV3 storage and action shims.
- Cleaned remaining user-facing SwitchyOmega wording from bundled locales and
  removed unused About/debug locale messages.
- Treated option records missing schemaVersion as unavailable config so
  installs with storage leftovers reset to default options instead of failing
  startup.

## v1.1.19

Route diagnostics and build target modernization.

- Added route trace diagnostics for inspecting how profile decisions resolve
  across direct, default, virtual, and rule-list profile flows.
- Migrated package tests from Mocha to Vitest while keeping tests running
  directly against TypeScript sources.
- Centralized browser entrypoint script ordering in generated sources and added
  build assumption checks for entrypoint and JavaScript target consistency.
- Raised TypeScript and esbuild JavaScript output targets to ES2022 across the
  workspace build.
- Removed remaining React migration leftovers and aligned route information
  naming.

## v1.1.18

Localization cleanup and extension startup fixes.

- Added the Interface language setting with persisted import/export support and
  bundled locale selection for the shipped languages.
- Pruned incomplete locale catalogs and aligned the Chinese locale source names
  with Hans/Hant language variants.
- Reworked PAC generation to use the local AST printer instead of UglifyJS and
  removed remaining Bluebird, heap, and FileSaver runtime dependencies.
- Fixed clean-install startup when default UI locale detection runs in the
  bundled browser-extension runtime.
- Kept options/profile reads responsive when proxy application fails during
  background initialization.
- Added Firefox extension smoke coverage and opened Firefox shortcut settings
  through the browser commands API when available.
- Adjusted Interface settings controls to match the existing Switch Options
  dropdown behavior.

## v1.1.17

Dependency, workspace, and proxy matching cleanup.

- Modernized runtime dependencies and bundled Bootstrap assets while keeping the
  extension build compatible with the updated toolchain.
- Adapted options sync to the newer limiter runtime and upgraded the Bluebird
  dependency.

  SwitchyAgain project layout.

  shipped by the extension build.
- Added local smoke tests for extension packaging, library loading, and UI
  entry points.

## v1.1.16

Build modernization and options style cleanup.

  source layout.
- Added a root dist packaging helper for copying release artifacts with
  versioned names.

React popup and options migration fixes.

- Continued the React TypeScript migration by tightening popup runtime,
  profile map, state, and condition API boundaries across the popup page and
  extension popup bridge.

  Bootstrap controls and workflows.

## v1.1.14

React options migration completion and profile editor fixes.

  migrated profile route and profile content flows.
- Fixed Auto Switch route query handling, CSP-safe PAC script preloading, and
  the About page PAC runtime error under MV3 CSP.
- Restored the profile title bar layout so the color and name stay on the left
  while profile action buttons align to the right.

  scroll position stability while keeping batched rule rendering.

## v1.1.13

React options migration and popup condition fixes.

  handling, and session state helpers out of the Angular controller.

  surfacing as unhandled promise rejections.

  active switch profile.

## v1.1.12

Chrome MV3 popup and options state fixes.

  keeping the MV3 popup menu entry point.

  the active profile, result profile list, and current page domain reliably.

  explicitly define a startup profile.

  does not support Firefox on Android.

  feedback, and imported-options dirty state handling.

  larger auto switch profiles.

  jumps and loading flashes.

  handlers, tab reload races, and fire-and-forget extension messages.

## v1.1.9

React options migration preview.
