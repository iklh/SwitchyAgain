SwitchyAgain is a fork of [SwitchyOmega](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega) focused on keeping the proxy switching
workflow available on modern browsers.

Changes from SwitchyOmega
-------------------------

- Migrated the Chromium/Firefox extension target to Manifest V3.
- Added compatibility handling for Chrome MV3 service workers and Firefox MV3
  background scripts.
- Kept the classic profile switching workflow, including fixed, direct, system,
  and PAC/rule-based profiles.
- Modernized the codebase around TypeScript workspace packages and React UI
  entry points.
- Renamed the extension to SwitchyAgain and maintains a separate version line
  for this fork.

Status
------

This fork is intended as a compatibility-focused continuation. Most original
documentation still applies unless noted otherwise.

Development
-----------
This repository uses npm workspaces for the proxy engine, extension runtime,
web UI, and browser extension packages.

For a normal local release build, the workflow is:

```sh
npm install
npm run release
npm run package:dist
```

`npm run release` builds the Chromium and Firefox extension archives under
`apps/browser-extension/release`.

`npm run package:dist` copies those archives to `dist/` with versioned
filenames.

Development and debugging commands:

- `npm run build` builds the unpacked browser extension without release
  archives.
- `npm run typecheck` checks all workspace TypeScript projects.
- `npm test` runs the proxy engine and extension runtime tests.
- `npm run smoke` runs the Chromium smoke checks only.
- `npm run smoke:firefox` runs the Firefox smoke checks.
